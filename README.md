- Styles are in `style.css` and individual project styles `style1.css`, `style2.css`, `style3.css`.
- JS is in `script.js` for smooth scrolling and reveal animations.

If you'd like, I can add a small script to serve this locally via a lightweight Python HTTP server for quicker preview or generate an optimized favicon and meta tags.
